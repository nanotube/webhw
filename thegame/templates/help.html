<h3>Auction mechanics</h3>

<p class="text">The auction mechanism used here is the classical "second-price sealed-bid auction", also known a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vickrey_auction">Vickrey auction</a>.</p>

<p class="text">In a Vickrey auction, each bidder only places one bid, the amount of which is hidden from other bidders. Then, when all the bids are compared, the highest bidder pays not his maximum bid, but the amount of the next higest bid. So, for example, if bidder A bids $100, and bidder B bids $200, bidder B wins the auction, but only pays $100 (the amount of bidder A's bid). Thus, bidder B doesn't have to worry about "overpaying" as he would in a first-price auction (where he pays the amount of his own bid, in this case, $200, and thus would want to lower his bid from his true value so it is as close to bidder A's bid as possible). Since the goal of this game is to encourage proper asset valuation, the second-price sealed-bid mechanism is used because it makes it rational for the auction participants to bid their true value, without having to worry about the valuations being used by other players.</p>

<p class="text">The exact auction mechanics used in this game are slightly different from a canonical Vickrey auction (only one sealed bid), in that over the course of the auction, the bidder is allowed to edit his bid amount any number of times, up until auction completion. Further, the number of bids placed on the auction is available. Upon auction completion, all [anonymized] bid amount are revealed. These deviations from a canonical second-price sealed auction do not change the value-revealing properties of the auction mechanism, and are taken for the following reasons:</p>

<table><tr><td style="text-align: left;">
<ul>
    <li>Student has the opportunity to reconsider his asset valuation. If an error is discovered, there's no penalty for fixing it, before the auction is over.</li>
    <li>Since it is rational for everyone to bid on every asset (even negative-value assets are bid on, in the framework of assuming a liability for a price), no value-relevant information is revealed in showing number of bids, but it is a little more interesting to be able to watch the progress of the auction.</li>
    <li>Post-auction bid revelation allows student to double-check that the auction result is correct.</li>
</ul>
</td></tr></table>

<p class="text">Tie resolution is accomplished by evenly dividing the asset among all tied high bidders, at the price of the tied high bid amount. This is done instead of "first come first served", in order to eliminate any benefits to speed in bidding, which would penalize those whose schedules do not permit immediate participation.</p>

<p class="text">The easiest way to show the auction mechanics is with some examples.</p>

<table><tr><td style="text-align: left;">
<ul>
    <li>Asset's true value is $300. Bidder A thinks the asset is worth $100, and places a bid in that amount. Bidder B thinks the asset is worth $200, and places a bid in that amount. If there are no other bidders, and A and B do not change their bids, the asset will go to bidder B, for $100 (second highest bid). Bidder B makes a profit of $200.</li>
    <li>Asset's true value is $300. Bidder A thinks the asset is worth $200, and places a bid in that amount. Bidder B thinks the asset is worth $200, and places a bid in that amount. If there are no other bidders, and A and B do not change their bids, we have a tie. The asset will be evenly partitioned between Bidders A and B, at a price of $200. Since the asset is worth $300, there's a total profit of $100, so each bidder makes a profit of $50.</li>
    <li>Asset's true value is $300. Bidder A thinks the asset is worth $200, and places a bid in that amount. No other bids are placed, so Bidder A wins by default. The asset is sold to Bidder A at a discount from his bid amount; the discount is defined by the instructor.</li>
    <li>Asset's true value is $300. Bidder A thinks the asset is worth $500, and places a bid in that amount. Bidder B thinks the asset is worth $600, and places a bid in that amount. The asset is sold to Bidder B at $500 (second highest bid), making him a loss of $200.</li>
</ul>
</td></tr></table>

<h3>Wealth calculation</h3>

<p class="text">Period wealth created is calculated in a straightforward way. The "true value" of the assets of the period is accrued to your account, while the "cost" of the assets (what you paid for them as a result of the auctions) is subtracted. Thus, if you paid less than the value of the assets, you would accumulate a positive profit, if you paid more, a loss, and zero change in wealth otherwise.</p>

<p class="text">If you spend less than your total cash assets, it is assumed that you lend out the remaining cash at the lending rate for the period. If you spend more than your total cash assets, it is assumed that you borrow the necessary funds at the borrowing rate for the period. For now, the borrowing and lending rates are the same, and equal to the period's risk-free rate. It is thus irrelevant whether you borrow or lend, since the present value of a loan is its cash amount. In short, don't worry about running out of cash.</p>

<p class="text">Let us look at some examples. If you started out with $100, and you bought the following assets in the period:</p>
<table><tr><td style="text-align: left;">
<ul>
    <li>Asset A, bought for $90, true value $100</li>
    <li>Asset B, bought for $200, true value $210</li>
    <li>Asset C, bought for $200, true value $190</li>
    <li>Asset D, bought for $150, true value $150</li>
</ul>
</td></tr></table>

<p class="text">Your end-of-period wealth is thus 100 + (- 90 + 100) + (- 200 + 210) + (-200 + 190) + (-150 + 150) = 110. You have created $10 of wealth.</p>

<p class="text">You may be wondering: since the auctions are second-price auctions, what happens if only one person bids on the auction? In that case, the sole bidder gets the asset at a discount from his bid. This discount is set by your instructor, and is visible below the period list on your user home page.</p>

<h3>Mean absolute error calculation</h3>

<p class="text">Your mean absolute error for a period is exactly what it sounds like - the average of the absolute differences between each asset's true value and the amount of the bid you placed on that asset's auction. Clearly, the lower the mean absolute error, the better.</p>

<p class="text">Let us look at some examples. Suppose you placed the following bids in a period:</p>
<table><tr><td style="text-align: left;">
<ul>
    <li>Asset A, true value $100, bid $100: your absolute error is 0.</li>
    <li>Asset B, true value $210, bid $200: your absolute error is 10</li>
    <li>Asset C, true value $150, bid $130: your absolute error is 20</li>
</ul>
</td></tr></table>

<p class="text">Your mean absolute error is thus (0 + 10 + 30)/3 = 10.</p>

<p class="text">What happens if you don't bid on an asset? You are assumed to make a "default" error, the amount of which is set by your instructor. This default value is visible below the period list on your user home page.</p>

<h3>Grading rubric</h3>

<p class="text">The grade for the period depends on your performance relative to the other students, along two metrics: wealth created, and mean absolute error.</p>

<p class="text">At the end of each period, the range of created wealths is scaled onto the standard 100-point grading scale, in a manner determined by your instructor.</p>

<p class="text">Additionally, a metric of 'mean absolute error' is calculated for each participant, which is the average of the absolute differences between each asset's true value and the amount of the bid placed on that asset's auction. The mean absolute error metric is also scaled onto the standard 100-point grading scale, in a manner determined by your instructor.</p>

<p class="text">The two grades will then be combined, each weighted as determined by your instructor.</p>
